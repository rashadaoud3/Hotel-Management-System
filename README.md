# 🏨 Hotel Management System

This repository contains a **Hotel Management System** developed for the **Database Management System (DBMS)** course. The system is built using **Java, JavaFX (Scene Builder), and SQL** to manage hotel operations efficiently.

## 📌 Features:
✔ **Room Management** – Add, update, and delete room details.  
✔ **Guest Management** – Register guests, check-in, and check-out.  
✔ **Booking System** – Handle room reservations with availability checks.  
✔ **Billing System** – Generate invoices and manage payments.  
✔ **Database Integration** – Store and retrieve data using SQL.  

## 🛠 Technologies Used:
- **Java** – Core logic and backend processing.  
- **JavaFX & Scene Builder** – GUI design and user interface.  
- **SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL)** – Database management for storing hotel data.  

## 📂 Project Structure:
- **/src** – Java source code.  
- **/resources** – FXML files, styles, and assets for the UI.  
- **/database** – SQL scripts for database setup.  

## 🚀 How to Run:
1. **Set up the database** – Import the SQL script from the `/database` folder.  
2. **Open the project** – Load it in an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse.  
3. **Run the JavaFX application** – Execute the main class.  

## 📄 Documentation:
A **PDF file** explaining the system’s design, database schema, and functionality is included.  

This project demonstrates the use of **DBMS principles** in a real-world hotel management scenario. 🏨✨
